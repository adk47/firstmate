# ak47/hdevops/apply.sh - land the ak47 hygiene deployment in H-DevOps as a PR.
#
# The hygiene system's code lives in firstmate. This script captures both the
# code and the deployment into an H-DevOps clone: the ak47 scripts, the two user
# timers, and the two sysctls that were hand-written on the box and recorded
# nowhere. It commits on a branch, pushes the branch, and opens a PR.
#
# It never pushes to the default branch, never merges, and never touches the
# clone's working tree beyond the payload paths it owns.
#
# The payload under ansible/playbooks/files/ak47/ is generated from the
# canonical ak47/ tree. Never edit it by hand.
#
# Usage: apply.sh [--repo DIR] [--branch NAME] [--dry-run] [--no-pr]
#                 [--check] [--write-payload]
#   --repo DIR       H-DevOps clone (default $FM_HOME/projects/H-DevOps)
#   --branch NAME    branch to create (default fm/ak47-hygiene-deployment)
#   --dry-run        show what would be copied and committed, change nothing
#   --no-pr          commit and push, but do not open a PR
#   --check          regenerate into a temp dir and diff the committed payload
#   --write-payload  regenerate the committed payload and exit
#
# Exit: 0 landed, 1 a step failed, 2 bad usage.

ak47: capture the hygiene deployment as code

ak47's /tmp held 950,700 entries on 2026-11-10, 831,000 of them the default
temp directory of a test suite that never removed it. Disk was 14% full, so
nothing that watched bytes ever looked; the cost landed on every glob, every
ls, every find and every test run, and showed up as load rather than as a
disk alert.

The same box locked up on 2026-11-10 with swap at 99-100% of 32 GB while 77 GB
of RAM sat free: nothing was watching swap, because systemd-oomd was not
installed and the health beat paged on load15 only, which never crossed 64.

What this commit captures is everything a rebuild would otherwise lose:

- the ak47 scripts, libraries, budget and producer table, installed under
  ~/.local/lib/ak47 so the units run without a firstmate checkout
- the two user timers that run the 5-minute tick and the Monday review
- the two sysctls that were hand-written on the box on 2026-11-03 and
  2026-11-10 and recorded nowhere else: vm.swappiness=10, which stopped the
  kernel paging 20 GB of idle agents to disk while 77 GB of RAM sat free, and
  fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192, which ~250 agents need
- systemd-oomd, with ManagedOOMSwap=kill on user@1000.service (systemd 255
  monitors swap only for `kill`, never for `auto`) and
  ManagedOOMPreference=avoid on the six units that are the fleet's spine
- ak47-health.sh and its 10-minute timer, now paging on swap >= 70%,
  available RAM < 15 GB, load, and 80% of the user task cap, and paging when
  the hygiene tick itself stops writing for 30 minutes
- the user task cap, both bounds: DefaultTasksMax=4096 in
  /etc/systemd/user.conf.d/60-ak47-tasksmax-user.conf, so one transient tmux
  pane scope can no longer take the whole slice, and TasksMax=24576 on
  user@1000.service, because on 2026-11-14 the uid reached pids.max 12000 and
  every fork in it returned EAGAIN for five hours

The playbook is not in site.yml on purpose: site.yml targets the OVH cluster,
and this targets one workstation over a local connection.

Revert is in the playbook header and keeps every log and quarantine directory.
