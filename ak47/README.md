# ak47 hygiene

The factory box's hygiene, as a system rather than a cleanup.

On 2026-11-10 ak47's `/tmp` held **950,700 entries**, 831,000 of them the default
temp directory of a Python or shell test suite that never removed it. The disk
was 14% full, so nothing that watched bytes ever looked. The cost was paid by
every glob, every `ls`, every `find` and every test run on the box, and it
surfaced as load rather than as a disk alert.

The sweeper is the smallest part of the answer. A sweeper that runs forever is a
symptom: it means the producers are still leaking and something has to keep
paying for it. This directory is the rest of the answer.

## The six parts

| # | Part | Where |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | A budget with numbers | `budget.conf`, rendered by `status.sh` |
| 2 | A producer census that stops growth at source | `census.sh`, `census-producers.conf`, `bin/fm-spawn.sh` |
| 3 | A deterministic tick | `tick.sh`, `units/ak47-devops.timer` |
| 4 | A guard on each producer | `guards/guard-producers.sh`, `guards/cleanup-patterns.conf` |
| 5 | Codification and self-monitoring | `hdevops/`, and the tick's own `loop_gap` |
| 6 | A weekly review that proposes diffs | `weekly-review.sh`, `units/ak47-devops-weekly.timer` |

## 1. The budget

`~/.local/state/ak47/status.md` is one screen. Every metric against its ceiling,
with the reason the ceiling is that number. Five seconds to read.

```
$ ak47/status.sh --print
```

| metric | ceiling | why that number |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `load15` | 32 | 2x the 32 threads; above it the box is not keeping up |
| `swap_pct` | 50 | the 2026-11-10 lockup ran at 99% swap with 77 GB RAM free |
| `mem_avail_gb` | 15 (floor) | one full test suite plus a browser needs ~15 GB |
| `tmp_entries` | 200,000 | 950k slowed every glob at 14% disk; 200k keeps readdir under a second |
| `tmp_gb` | 20 | a week of live scratch fits in 20 GB; 163 GB was leaked test scratch |
| `root_disk_pct` | 85 | ext4 fragments badly past 85%; 540 GB of headroom remains |
| `tmux_core_pct` | 100 | the tmux server idles at ~74% of one core with 81 panes |
| `agent_count` | 160 | 160 agents is where per-agent CPU share crosses the load ceiling |
| `pids_pct` | 80 | 2026-11-14 the uid hit 12000 of 12000 tasks and every fork failed for 5 h; 80% is where ordinary bursts still fit |

A ceiling without a reason is a number nobody can defend, so `budget.conf`
refuses to load a row that has none.

## 2. The producer census

Counting is not a census. For every class of growth, the census names the file
and line that creates it, and the fix is at that line.

```
$ ak47/census.sh                 # counts per producer, right now
$ ak47/census.sh --watch 60      # what appeared in 60s, and which pid made it
$ ak47/census.sh --check         # did any producer grow since the baseline?
```

| producer | count | created by |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `tmp` + 8 chars | 466,233 | Python `tempfile.mkdtemp()` default |
| `tmp.` + 10 chars | 366,414 | shell `mktemp -d` default |
| `uvn-` | 46,348 | `hydra/scripts/tests/test_uvn_status.py:224` |
| `restore-test-` | 5,544 | `core-backend/src/commands/restoreRevertedApprovals.test.js:60` |
| `merge-outcome-` | 3,672 | `hydra/scripts/tests/test_merge_outcome_notify.py:109` |
| `csv-` | 3,105 | `core-backend/scripts/claim-surface-verify.test.js:26` |
| `wc-` | 2,395 | `hydra/scripts/tests/test_uvn_status.py:1683` |
| `twin-req-` | 2,237 | **unattributed** — a mock-GitHub harness, no current checkout |
| `puppeteer_dev_chrome_profile-` | 1,906 | puppeteer/playwright launches |
| `irc-` | 1,770 | `hydra/scripts/tests/test_intercom_reconcile.py:370` |
| `rmtc-` | 2,324 | `core-backend/src/commands/repairMissingTrackCredits.test.js:127` |
| `uvn-lens-` | 534 | `hydra/scripts/tests/test_fraud_lens.py:233` |
| unattributed | 51,260 | — |

The two systemic rows are the ones that matter. 41 of 59 hydra test files call
`mkdtemp` with no `rmtree`, `addCleanup` or `tearDownClass` — 126 call sites.
Fixing them one at a time is a losing game, so the source fix is one line in
`bin/fm-spawn.sh`: every task now gets `TMPDIR=${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/fm/<id>/tmp`,
and teardown removes that whole root. A leak that lands there is removed by the
task that caused it when the task reaches teardown. Nothing reaps
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/fm/<id>` yet, so a root left by a refused or
aborted spawn stays until removed by hand. A leak that lands in `/tmp` is
removed by nobody.
Tasks spawned before that move still record and clean up their `/tmp/fm-<id>`
root, which is what `orphan-task-scratch` below still reaps when the task record
is gone.

## 3. The tick

`units/ak47-devops.timer` runs `tick.sh --apply` every five minutes. No model, no
tokens, no network. It samples, self-heals an enumerated table of classes, and
writes **one line every run** so silence is provable:

```
2026-11-10T20:51:42Z tick mode=apply tmp_before=953742 tmp_after=953100 moved=642 deleted=0 busy=118 protected=9 failures=0 actions=642 loop_gap=300s classes=tmp-mktemp:610,tmp-producer:32 breaches=tmp_entries=953100>200000 top=tmp:466233,tmp.:366414,uvn-:46348
```

The table is bounded and every action carries its revert:

| class | action | revert |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `tmp-mktemp` | quarantine a leaked default temp dir | `mv` it back from `quarantine/<date>/` |
| `tmp-producer` | quarantine a leaked named producer dir | same |
| `orphan-task-scratch` | quarantine a `/tmp/fm-<id>` with no live task record | same |
| `quarantine-expire` | delete a quarantined entry after 7 days | none — it is already 7 days past its leak |

The four classes in the table are armed by default. `dead-pane`,
`stale-lock` and `disk` are report-only and never act. `swap-pressure` and
`fat-process` are report-only until an operator sets `swap_pressure=1` or
`fat_process=1` in `~/.config/ak47/devops.conf`; once armed, swap-pressure
reclaims swap when RAM is free, and fat-process renices the process to 19,
sends `SIGTERM`, and sends `SIGKILL` if it survives five minutes.

The agent wakes only for findings the table cannot settle, and at most once per
six hours per finding key.

### A bounded tick may not call an unbounded sampler

`tmp_gb` needs `du`, and on 2026-11-14 `du` over 698 GB of `/tmp` stopped
finishing at all. The value was cached, the cache went stale, and every run
blocked inside the sampler until systemd killed the unit at its start timeout:
five hours with no `devops.log` line, and nothing watching the tick's silence
closely enough to notice. The tick is the sampler, so a sampler that can hang is
a loop that can die.

The walk now runs under `timeout` (`AK47_DU_BUDGET`, default 90 s). If it does
not finish, the budget scores the last known size, and once that size is older
than two refresh intervals the tick files `tmp-gb-stale` instead of letting a
stale picture drive the sweep. The rule this leaves behind: **a budget metric
whose sample is unbounded must return a number or say it could not measure** —
never block, and never invent.

The delete path had the same shape and the same cure. `safe-delete.sh` used
`lsof -t +D` to prove nothing held a quarantined entry; that scan is recursive,
so a quarantine directory worth deleting was exactly the size at which it ran
past the unit's start timeout. The tick now builds **one** in-use set per run
(`ak47_inuse_scan`: a single pass over every process's cwd, root, exe and open
files, ~0.5 s on this box) and tests each candidate against it in constant time.
An incomplete set — one without its completion marker — answers `2` (*could not
tell*), never `1` (*free*), so the failure mode of the optimisation is a refusal
rather than a deletion. Expiry is also bounded per run by
`quarantine_expire_max`, and the tick line carries `expire_pending=` so a
deferred backlog is visible instead of looking like a stuck loop.

### The big-entry take-down

The tick only ever moves a name the producer table enumerates, behind a 24-hour
idle gate. That is the right shape for routine hygiene and it is useless once
`/tmp` has already grown to hundreds of GB: the biggest offenders are
directories no producer row names (a scratch cache, a lane's dump, an eight-GB
`chg/`), and none of them will ever shrink on their own.

`ak47/tmp-takedown.sh` exists for that state, and it is deliberately narrow:

- **size first** - it ranks `/tmp`'s top-level entries by size (one bounded `du`
  per child, never a recursive walk of the whole tree) and works from the top;
- **age, but never age alone** - an entry must be idle for the age gate *and*
  hold no open handle *and* be outside every protected pattern *and* not be a
  live task's scratch root *and* not be a mountpoint;
- **quarantine, never delete** - every entry is renamed into a dated directory
  under the ak47 state dir, and its exact `mv` revert is printed;
- **bounded** - at most `AK47_TAKEDOWN_MAX` entries (default 20) per run.

```
$ ak47/tmp-takedown.sh --dry-run
tmp-takedown: held or unprovable, leaving alone: /tmp/big (rc=0)
tmp-takedown: DRY-RUN would quarantine /tmp/old-junk 7820KB idle=72h
tmp-takedown: moved=0 skipped=4 failures=0 freed_gb=0
```

A run is a decision, not a sweep: the only reason this exists rather than a
config knob on the tick is that the entries worth moving are ones the system
cannot classify, so a human reads the plan before it happens.


## 4. The guards

```
$ ak47/guards/guard-producers.sh
pass static:uvn            test_uvn_status.py still cleans up after itself
fail static:wc             test_uvn_status.py creates wc- and never removes it
pass systemic:per-task-tmpdir  bin/fm-spawn.sh exports a per-task TMPDIR
fail dynamic:py-mkdtemp    py-mkdtemp grew 12,400 since the baseline
pass payload:hdevops       committed payload matches ak47/
```

Four independent checks:

- **static** — a file that matches a `create` pattern must also match a
  `cleanup` pattern. A file absent from the checkout is skipped, not failed.
- **systemic** — `bin/fm-spawn.sh` must still export a per-task `TMPDIR`.
- **dynamic** — `census.sh --check` against a baseline the check never moves. A
  check that rewrites its own reference can only ever see one interval.
- **payload** — the committed H-DevOps payload must match the canonical `ak47/`
  tree. The payload is generated, so a source edit that was not regenerated
  fails here instead of shipping stale code to a rebuild.

Without this, the source fix rots and the sweeper becomes load-bearing again.

## 5. Codification and self-monitoring

`hdevops/apply.sh` lands the system in H-DevOps as a PR: the ak47 scripts,
libraries, budget and producer table, the hygiene user timers, the two sysctls
that were hand-written on the box and recorded nowhere else, systemd-oomd
with its swap and avoid drop-ins, the two task-cap drop-ins described in §5a,
and the health beat that pages on swap and memory pressure as well as load and
the user task cap. The playbook is
`ansible/playbooks/07-ak47-hygiene.yml`, deliberately not in `site.yml` — that
targets the OVH cluster, this targets one workstation.

The payload under `hdevops/ansible/playbooks/files/ak47/` is generated from the
canonical `ak47/` tree by `apply.sh`; never edit it by hand. `apply.sh --check`
diffs the committed payload against a fresh generation, and
`apply.sh --write-payload` regenerates it. The guard's `payload` check runs the
same comparison, so CI fails when a source edit was not regenerated.

The tick watches its own log freshness. A `loop_gap` over three intervals is a
finding, because a loop that dies silently is worse than no loop. It also flags
a report-only class that has outlived its 24 h dry run, so the "then armed" step
cannot be forgotten; it never arms itself.

A finding's dedupe key is committed only after the chair-inbox note is actually
delivered. A key touched before a failed send would silence the finding for six
hours, so a failed delivery is logged as `DELIVERY-FAILED` and retried next tick.

## 5a. The task cap that stopped the box

On 2026-11-14 the uid reached `pids.max` 12000 at 02:49Z and stayed there until
08:04Z. Every `fork()` returned `EAGAIN`, so the watcher, every worker shell and
every check failed to start for five hours. Nothing paged: tasks are cheap, so
load, swap and available RAM all stayed inside their ceilings while the uid was
already unable to fork.

The tasks were in tmux child-pane scopes, not in a service. Three scopes
accounted for it (`tmux-spawn-c2f9b92f` peaked at 138,696 tasks, `-b4f3563c` at
41,025, `-457529e5` at 7,758), and the frame was only the frame: the cap was the
only bound, 12000 was barely above the ~4,600 the slice normally runs, and no
unit inside the slice was capped at anything — each inherited 140,836 and shared
nothing, so one lane could take the whole uid.

Three changes, all landed by `hdevops/ansible/playbooks/07-ak47-hygiene.yml`:

1. **A per-unit default** — `/etc/systemd/user.conf.d/60-ak47-tasksmax-user.conf`
   sets `DefaultTasksMax=4096`. This is the change that matters: transient tmux
   pane scopes have no drop-in path, and the user manager's default is the only
   place a per-unit cap can reach them. 4096 is four times the largest
   legitimate lane measured here (the biggest real pane held ~950 tasks), and a
   sixth of the slice cap.
2. **A slice cap with room** — `/etc/systemd/system/user@1000.service.d/60-ak47-tasksmax-slice.conf`
   sets `TasksMax=24576`, six times the per-unit default. Raising it alone would
   have moved the cliff, not removed it, so both land together.
3. **An alert at 80% of the cap** — `ak47-health.sh` pages at 80% and writes
   `~/.local/state/ak47/tasks-latest.md` naming the scopes holding the tasks;
   `pids_pct` is also a budget row, so the tick samples it every five minutes
   and the weekly review can propose moving it.

### Why systemd-oomd does not watch this host, and the one line that changes it

The swap drop-in is installed and `systemctl show user@1000.service` reports
`ManagedOOMSwap=kill`, yet the 2026-11-10 lockup ran at 99% swap and oomd did
nothing, and `oomctl` lists **no** monitored cgroups. Three verified reasons:

1. **The slice is not watched.** `user@1000.service` resolves
   `MemoryPressureWatch=skip`, so the kernel collects no memory pressure (PSI)
   for it. oomd acts on pressure readings; with no reading there is nothing to
   act on. The packaged
   `/usr/lib/systemd/system/user@.service.d/10-oomd-user-service-defaults.conf`
   sets `ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=kill` and a 50% limit, which is why the policy
   looks armed — but the policy alone does not start the watch.
   Proven on this box: a transient scope started with
   `-p MemoryPressureWatch=on -p ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=kill` appears in
   `oomctl` under "Memory Pressure Monitored CGroups" with live `Avg10`; the same
   scope without the watch does not.
2. **Swap pressure does not exist on this kernel.** `/proc/pressure/` has `cpu`,
   `io` and `memory` and nothing else, so `ManagedOOMSwap=kill` can never fire
   here. oomd's `Swap Used Limit: 90%` is the only swap lever and it is not
   per-cgroup, so a slice that swaps instead of paging stays invisible.
3. **The drop-in postdates the unit.** `user@1000.service` entered active at
   2026-11-05 19:42 and the swap drop-in was installed 2026-11-10, so the running
   unit has never read it. `daemon-reload` alone does not re-apply service
   properties to a running unit.

**Swap reclamation needs root too.** The tick's `swap-pressure` action does
`swapoff -a` then `swapon -a`; both are root-only, and the tick runs as a user
unit, so it would WARN and count a failure every tick on a full swap while swap
stayed full. It now proves the capability with `swap_privileged` before trying,
and files `swap-unprivileged` — the one line Aaron needs, not a transient error.
The 2026-11-14 reclaim was run by hand and took swap from 31.9 GB of 31.9 GB to
0 (RAM 69 GB used, 54 GB available). To let the tick do it, one sudoers rule:

```
printf 'aaron ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/swapoff -a, /sbin/swapon -a\n' \
  | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/60-ak47-swap
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/60-ak47-swap
# revert: sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/60-ak47-swap
```

Aaron's call, not the tick's — enabling the watch lets oomd kill the largest
cgroup under the slice after 20 s at 50% pressure, and that cgroup can be a
worker, a lane, or the chair:

```
# see it, immediately, without touching the running configuration:
sudo systemctl set-property --runtime user@1000.service MemoryPressureWatch=on
oomctl | sed -n '/Memory Pressure Monitored CGroups/,$p'

# make it survive, with the revert:
printf '[Service]\nMemoryPressureWatch=on\n' \
  | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@1000.service.d/60-ak47-oomd-mem.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# revert: sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/user@1000.service.d/60-ak47-oomd-mem.conf
#         && sudo systemctl set-property --runtime user@1000.service MemoryPressureWatch=skip
```

The per-unit default is read when the user manager starts, and restarting
`user@1000.service` would restart every unit in the slice — the fleet-wide
disruption this change exists to prevent. So it applies at the next login; the
slice cap applies without one. Aaron's one-liner, if applying by hand:

```
sudo install -D -m644 ak47/hdevops/ansible/playbooks/templates/60-ak47-tasksmax-user.conf \
  /etc/systemd/user.conf.d/60-ak47-tasksmax-user.conf
sudo install -D -m644 ak47/hdevops/ansible/playbooks/templates/60-ak47-tasksmax-slice.conf \
  /etc/systemd/system/user@1000.service.d/60-ak47-tasksmax-slice.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Revert: remove both files and `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`. The bound returns
to 12000 on the next unit start; nothing is restarted either way.

## 6. The weekly review

`units/ak47-devops-weekly.timer` runs `weekly-review.sh` on Monday at 09:00. It
reads its own `samples.log`, computes p05/p50/p95/max per metric, and proposes a
unified diff against `budget.conf`:

- **raise** when p95 sits within 20% of a `max` ceiling, or p05 within 20% of a
  `min` floor — the ceiling is about to be the thing that pages
- **lower** when p95 is below half a `max` ceiling, or p05 is more than twice a
  `min` floor — the ceiling has drifted away from what the box does

It writes the diff to `~/.local/state/ak47/review-<date>.diff` and files it. It
never applies it, never adds a class to the tick's table, and never widens its
own authority. A new action class needs the captain's word.

## Safety

`/tmp` is load-bearing on this box. The tick refuses before it deletes:

- **Never by age alone.** A candidate must match a producer pattern *and* be
  older than its class threshold *and* be held by no live process.
- **Never a live task's scratch.** `/tmp/fm-<id>` from a pre-move task is protected while
  `state/<id>.meta` exists.
- **Never a named protected path.** `/tmp/fm-move`, `/tmp/ak47-*`, the `:8317`
  forwarder, `orcad-*`, `systemd-*`, `snap*`, X11 sockets and locks, and anything
  matching `*router*.sh`, `*forward*`, `cli-proxy*`, `*.token`.
- **Never anything a running process holds.** One `/proc` scan collects every
  top-level `/tmp` name any live process has as its cwd, root, exe, or an open
  file descriptor. That set is checked twice: once in the classifier, once again
  immediately before the move.
- **Never a mount point.** The kernel's octal-escaped mount table is decoded
  before comparison.
- **Never a path spelled two ways.** Every path comparison canonicalises *both*
  sides with `realpath -m` and prints both spellings when they differ. A safety
  check that compares paths must first prove both sides spell the path the same
  way.

Deletion is two-phase: a candidate is `mv`'d into
`~/.local/state/ak47/quarantine/<date>/` and only deleted after
`quarantine_days`. The `mv` is the revert, and it is printed on the log line.

The tick never signals the tmux server, `orca-serve`, `cli-proxy-api`,
`kube-tunnel-node1`, or the chair. It never reboots. It never runs PromQL
locally — the box has no route to cluster ClusterIPs.

### Proof that it refuses

Run against a real tree under `/tmp`, with every age gate set to `0` so nothing
is spared by time. The two holders are real processes; the two records are the
real gates.

```
$ ls /tmp/ak47-demo
drain-old  fm-livetask  fm-move  spelled-fm-move  tmpa003ltt_
           tmp.abcdefghij  uvn-abc123

# a process sitting in tmpa003ltt_, a process with a file open in
# tmp.abcdefghij, a live task record for fm-livetask, and a symlink spelled
# /tmp//ak47-demo/fm-move (two slashes) that resolves to the protected fm-move
$ ( cd /tmp/ak47-demo/tmpa003ltt_ && sleep 40 ) &
$ ( exec 3</tmp/ak47-demo/tmp.abcdefghij/open.txt; sleep 40 ) &
$ printf 'window=x:fm-livetask\n' >$FM_HOME/state/livetask.meta
$ ln -s /tmp//ak47-demo/fm-move /tmp/ak47-demo/spelled-fm-move

$ ak47/tick.sh --apply
$ ls /tmp/ak47-demo
drain-old  fm-livetask  fm-move  spelled-fm-move  tmpa003ltt_  tmp.abcdefghij
$ ls ~/.local/state/ak47/quarantine/*/
uvn-abc123

tick mode=apply tmp_before=7 tmp_after=6 moved=1 deleted=0 busy=2 \
     protected=1 failures=0 actions=1 classes=tmp-producer:1
```

It declined the directory a process was sitting in, the directory a process had
a file open in, the live task's scratch root, the protected `fm-move` name, and
the symlink whose two-slash spelling canonicalises onto it. It left `drain-old`
alone because no producer row names it: an unenumerated class is never acted on.
It quarantined the one entry nothing held. `tests/ak47-tick.test.sh` runs this as
a test, in both directions, for every protected path and every producer prefix.

### Measured so far

The loop has been armed since 2026-11-10T21:20Z. This is the trend, not a
snapshot; the 7-day acceptance gate is 2026-11-17.

| metric | first tick | latest tick | ceiling |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `/tmp` entries | 954,210 | 117,171 | 200,000 |
| load15 | 18.03 | 17.02 | 32 |
| swap | 44% | 44% | 50% |
| `tmp_gb` | 162 | 110 | 20 |

Every entry that left `/tmp` is in `~/.local/state/ak47/quarantine/<date>/` with
its `mv` revert, deleted only after seven days. `devops.log` has one line per
run, so the trend is provable without a second source.

## Install

```
$ ak47/install.sh --dry-run     # show every action
$ ak47/install.sh               # install, run one tick, record the baseline
$ ak47/install.sh --uninstall   # remove the units, keep every log
```

## Configuration

`~/.config/ak47/devops.conf`, seeded by `install.sh` with every key set to its
default. Absent keys take the default in the right-hand column.

| key | default | what it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `tmp_mktemp_min` | 1440 | minutes a leaked default temp dir must be idle before it is quarantined |
| `tmp_producer_min` | 1440 | the same, for a named producer prefix (`uvn-`, `wc-`, `irc-`, ...) |
| `orphan_min` | 10080 | minutes a `/tmp/fm-<id>` with no live task record must be idle |
| `quarantine_days` | 7 | days a quarantined entry is kept before it is deleted for good |
| `tmp_max_entries` | 5000 | stop working once `/tmp` is back under this many entries |
| `tmp_max_moves` | 2000 | the most entries one run may move |
| `quarantine_expire_max` | 200 | the most expired entries one run may delete; the rest wait, and the line says how many |
| `swap_pressure` | 0 | arm the swap-pressure class: reclaim swap when RAM is free |
| `fat_process` | 0 | arm the fat-process class: renice, `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 5 min |
| `fat_process_gb` | 3 | the RSS a process must hold to count as fat |
| `fat_process_min` | 10 | minutes a fat process must hold it before it is reported |
| `interval_seconds` | 300 | the timer's period, so the tick can notice its own loop has stopped |

A fat process that ignores `SIGTERM` is `SIGKILL`ed after five minutes. The
escalation clock is `~/.local/state/ak47/fat.term`, so it survives across ticks,
and a dry run neither kills nor consumes the record.

The per-task `TMPDIR` and its `config/task-tmpdir` opt-out are firstmate
configuration, owned by [`docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md#per-task-temporary-directory-configtask-tmpdir).

## Tests

```
$ bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/ak47-*.test.sh
```

104 tests across seven files: the budget, the census, the guards, the guarded
delete, the big-entry take-down, the tick, and the weekly review. They are hermetic — no tmux, no
network, no live fleet state — and registered as `pure-contract-unit` in
`bin/fm-test-run.sh`.

## Acceptance, after 7 days

- `/tmp` entries under 200,000 and **stable**, not merely swept
- `load15` under 32 at p95
- swap under 50%
- the producer census shows zero unexplained growth

Report the trend, not a snapshot. `weekly-review.sh` is what produces it.
