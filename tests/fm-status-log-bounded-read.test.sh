# tests/fm-status-log-bounded-read.test.sh - bounded-cost proof for the per-task
# status-log reads in the supervision path.
#
# A long-lived monitoring lane legitimately produces a multi-megabyte
# append-only status log. The 2026-09 incident: several lanes crossed 2-5 MB and
# every per-task read that walked the whole file made the watcher's first poll,
# the wake drain, the fleet snapshot, and session start take minutes - windows
# where a firstmate turn could end with supervision off. The captain's standing
# rule is that firstmate's own monitoring never goes down, so every per-task
# read must be bounded by the bytes it actually needs, never by the log's
# lifetime size, without loosening a deadline or dropping a wake.
#
# The deterministic assertions here are the byte-count read probes the production
# code publishes (FM_STATUS_TAIL_READ_PROBE, FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_READ_PROBE), so a
# regression that re-reads the whole log fails on the recorded byte count rather
# than on a wall-clock sample. The wall-clock bounds exist only to fail a
# pathological regression loudly; each is env-overridable so a loaded box cannot
# turn them into a false failure.
